# CAGE
comprehensive ASD Geneotype evaluator

cage.cpp includes the weight and cluster finder algorithms.
cageOnlyClassify and cageOnlyClassifyDecreasing are classifier algorithms that only works if the clusters-weights are already found

Since versions are still experimental there are a lot of parameters to get different clusters-results.
